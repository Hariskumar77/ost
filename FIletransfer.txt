Aim: To share files between Linux and Windows

Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol, originally
developed by Andrew Tridgell. As of version 3, Samba provides file and print services for
various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Windows Server domain, either as
a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or as a domain member. It can also be part of an Active
Directory domain.

Samba can be used with Linux to provide transparent access between systems running Linux and systems
running Windows. Samba itself runs on a Linux system and makes shared files and printers available to
Windows system, as if they are available on a Window system or server. Thus, Samba has several
practical applications which can generally be categorized as follows:

1. Using a Linux server as a simple peer-to-peer server. There is no user authentication involved and no
need for passwords.
2. Using a Linux server as a member server on an existing Windows NT domain. The existing
Windows domain controller will use NT authentication tools to control file permissions and access.
3. Using a Linux server as a primary domain controller with its own user authentication and
control mechanisms. Which of these three applications of Samba is used, determines how Samba is
configured on the Linux system.


1. Samba Installation
[ostlab@ostlab ~]$ su
Password:
[root@ostlab ostlab]# yum install samba


2. Check samba status
[root@ostlab ostlab]# service smb status
smbd is stopped
Start samba service
[root@ostlab ostlab]# service smb start
Starting SMB services: [ OK ]
Restart samba service
[root@ostlab ostlab]# service smb restart
Shutting down SMB services: [ OK ]
Starting SMB services: [ OK ]
[root@ostlab ostlab]#


3. Disable firewall
[root@ostlab ostlab]# service iptables status

[root@ostlab ostlab]# service iptables stop
iptables: Flushing firewall rules: [ OK ]
iptables: Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter [ OK ]
iptables: Unloading modules: [ OK ]
[root@ostlab ostlab]# service ip6tabls stop


4. Enforce Permissive State
[root@ostlab ostlab]# getenforce
Enforcing
[root@ostlab ostlab]# setenforce
usage: setenforce [ Enforcing | Permissive | 1 | 0 ]
[root@ostlab ostlab]# setenforce 0
[root@ostlab ostlab]# getenforce
Permissive


Creating a normal user
# useradd samba-test
Setting the password
# passwd samba-test
Changing password for user samba-test.
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
Adding the user to access samba shares with a password
# smbpasswd -a samba-test
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
Added user samba-test.
Login into the samba as using the smbclient to add the files and folders to share with windows
# smbclient \\\\localhost\\samba-test -Usamba-test
Here enter smb password for login
Enter samba-test&#39;s password:
You gets the following output to see the what are files you are sharing
Domain=[MYGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.5.8-68.fc15]
smb: \&gt;
In this to see what are files you sharing enter ‘ls’ command

smb: \&gt; ls

To see the where your current directory located enter
the ‘pwd‘ command smb: \&gt; pwd
Current directory is \\localhost\samba-test\
To create a folder in sharing folder enter following command
smb: \&gt; mkdir test
To check created directory enter the following command
smb: \&gt; ls

If you want to come out from samba client enter the „exit‟
smb: \&gt; exit
How to access the shared files from windows.
Open the samba location as following.
Start-&gt; Run..
Enter the ip address of linux machine as following
eg: \\192.168.1.2
It displays log in window to log into the samba sever.
Here username and password should be what you given to while creating samba
username and smb password.
eg: username: samba-test
password:test123
Now you can see the what are files shared.



RESULT: Thus a SAMBA file server has been installed in Linux
machine and the files have been accessed in a Windows machine.
