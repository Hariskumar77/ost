Aim :
To setup Network Interface using ifconfig command and the related system files


Setting up Network Interfaces
To see how your network is configured on your computer, use the ifconfig command. Note that this
command is in the /sbin directory and this directory is not in normal users&#39;s path and only in root&#39;s path.
So, as normal user, you will have to use &quot;/sbin/ifconfig&quot; command on the command prompt. As root just
using &quot;ifconfig&quot; will do. Here is an example output if this command is used as a normal user:
[ostlab@ostlab ~]$ ifconfig

Static IP addresses are manually assigned to a computer by an administrator. The exact procedure varies
according to platform. This contrasts with dynamic IP addresses, which are assigned either by the
computer interface or host software itself, as in Zeroconf, or assigned by a server using Dynamic Host


Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
Assigning IP Address, Netmask and gateway using ifconfig command
IP address : 192.168.1.100 (An unused IP)
netmask : 255.255.255.0
IP address of the default gateway : 192.168.1.1
[ostlab@ostlab ~]$ su
Password:
[root@ostlab ostlab]# mii-tool
eth0: negotiated 100baseTx-FD flow-control, link ok
To Assign IP address and netmask
[root@ostlab ostlab]# ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0
[root@ostlab ostlab]#
To Assign gateway
[root@ostlab ostlab]# route add default gw 192.168.1.1
[root@ostlab ostlab]# route -n

These settings are not permanent. It&#39;s go away the next time you boot. For permanent setting use the
following steps.
[root@ostlab ostlab]# vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
Change the values as shown below and save

[root@ostlab ostlab]# service network restart

[root@ostlab
ostlab]#ifconfig
[root@ostlab
ostlab]# routeâ€“n
Managing iptables
[root@ostlab
ostlab]#service iptables start 
[root@ostlab ostlab]#service iptables stop

[root@ostlab ostlab]#service iptables restart


RESULT: The network has been configured with new ip, gateway and netmask.
